# Start
python3 ConnectedScreens.py

# Convert UI files to Python
pyuic6 input.ui -o output.py

### TODO:   
1. Figure out how to get the images back 
2. Make sure all of the buttons are properly names in a meaningful way 
3. Regenerate screens and convert to python files 

4. Figure out how to use config so we can reuse screens 
5. Devise a way to send information to backend 
    - We decided to do global structures (dictionary) for 4 & 5 

6. Find a way to allow unlimited number of freeway sections in Config.py
