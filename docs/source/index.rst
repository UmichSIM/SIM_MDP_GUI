Carla-GUI

GUI tool to help human-vehicle interaction researchers design and conduct traffic experiments with `CARLA real-time driving simulator <https://carla.org/>`_.

Project Purpose
===============
The CARLA simulator is a powerful open source tool developed to "support
development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems"
(introduction, CARLA Simulator). To properly utilize the powerful functionality
provided by the CARLA simulator, however, users need to have:

* an in depth understanding about the function provided by the simulator
* basic knowledge about vehicle control
* basic knowledge about python

Meeting all these requirements is definitely not easy for begining researchers
in the field of human-vehicle interaction. To make life easier for those
researchers, a simple GUI has been developed, which provides an interface for
users to create and conduct experiments using the CARLA simulator.

Check out the :doc:`setup` section for a quickstart. Check :doc:`api` section for API reference.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
