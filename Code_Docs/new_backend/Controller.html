        Abstract function that dictates how a derived Controller class should update the Vehicles control.

        All derived controller classes must implement this method. The update_control method takes in a
        vehicle and determines what control parameters should be passed to it to update its acceleration
        and steering in the Carla simulation. This function will call apply_control on the current
        vehicle to steer the vehicle in the correct direction.

        stop at that location. This mode is activated if the current_vehicle has a valid target location
        and the vehicle is within its pre-defined breaking distance.

        In target_distance mode, the vehicle will accelerate or decelerate as necessary to maintain a
        target distance from the vehicle in-front of it. This mode is activated if there is a vehicle in front
        of the current vehicle within 1.2 times the current vehicle&#39;s safety distance. This mode can never be
        activated for a lead vehicle.
