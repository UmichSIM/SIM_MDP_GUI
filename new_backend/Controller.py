Backend - Controller Class
Created on Tue February 15, 2022

Summary: The Controller class is a base class that implements control over the vehicles in the
    Simulation. Specific constants of the Controller can be specified in the constructor. This class
    provides the basic interface that all Controller classes MUST follow. Ego, Intersection, and
    Freeway controllers are derived from this base class
